<h1>The Best Movies According To Jackson</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Akira</h3>
<p>Themes of god and power corrupting colide in a mass of flesh that grotesquely depicts mankinds flaws.</p>
<h3>The Island</h3>
<p>An interesting tale set in a more interesting backdrop. The set design and overall artistic direction fills me with deep nostalgia for days playing portal.</p>
<h3>A Cabin In The Woods</h3>
<p>A must watch for any lover of the horror genre, what appears to be a cliche by the book plot quickly turns regular tropes on their heads in a unique parody of the genre.</p>
