<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 24 year old digital entreprenuer, I have backgrounds in game design and development, music production and Djing, as well as data engineering
  and consulting. Currently I am upskilling and working my way towards creating my ideal lifestyle. 
</p>

<p>My perfect life looks like spending a few hours a day on health and fitness, a couple on learning and development, a few more on running my business,
  and then spending the rest of my time practicing on my CDJs, enjoying whatever exotic location I'm parked up in, or spending time with the people I love.</p>
